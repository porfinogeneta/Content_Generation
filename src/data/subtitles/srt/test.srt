00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,460
 not just 

3 
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:00,760
 any fox, 

4 
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,080
 he was 

5 
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,220
 a blur 

6 
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:01,560
 of russet 

7 
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:01,760
 and white, 

8 
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 a whisper 

9 
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:02,480
 of motion 

10 
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,720
 through the 

11 
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,120
 ancient emberwood 

12 
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,360
 forest. 

13 
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:03,960
 His paws, 

14 
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,300
 light as 

15 
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:04,720
 falling leaves, 

16 
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,240
 barely disturbed 

17 
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,580
 the mossy 

18 
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:05,960
 ground as 

19 
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,220
 he weaved 

20 
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:06,640
 between gnarled 

21 
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:06,900
 roots and 

22 
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,480
 towering ferns. 

23 
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,020
 Today the 

24 
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,300
 center of 

25 
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,420
 a plump 

26 
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:08,780
 field mouse 

27 
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,080
 had drawn 

28 
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,240
 him to 

29 
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,420
 the edge 

30 
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:09,620
