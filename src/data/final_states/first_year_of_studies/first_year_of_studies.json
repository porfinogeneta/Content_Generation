    "title": "Survived my first year of university, and wow, what a ride!",
    "text": "Okay, so I just finished my first year of university, and I honestly don't know whether to laugh, cry, or just sleep for a week straight. Coming in, I was a mix of terrified and incredibly excited. New city, new people, no parents telling me to clean my room – pure freedom, right? Well, not exactly.\n\nThe first semester was a blur of trying to figure out where my classes were, deciphering syllabi that looked like ancient texts, and attempting to cook anything beyond instant noodles. My roommate, bless her heart, was a night owl who studied with a headlamp, while I was a morning person. We eventually found a rhythm, mostly involving me wearing earplugs and her tiptoeing around at 3 AM.\n\nAcademically, it was a huge adjustment. High school felt like a walk in the park compared to the sheer volume of reading and the depth of critical thinking required. I remember one particular essay for my Intro to Philosophy class. I spent literally three days in the library, fueled by questionable coffee and sheer panic, only to get a 'C'. It felt like a punch to the gut, but it also taught me that effort doesn't always equal immediate success, and sometimes you just need to ask for help (which I eventually did, from a very patient TA).\n\nSocially, it was a rollercoaster. I joined a few clubs, went to countless awkward 'mixer' events, and slowly but surely, found my people. There were nights out that ended with us laughing until our sides hurt, and quiet evenings spent studying together in the common room. I learned that it's okay if not everyone likes you, and that true friends are the ones who show up with snacks when you're having a meltdown over an exam.\n\nThe biggest lesson? Independence is a double-edged sword. It's amazing to make your own choices, but it also means you're responsible for the consequences. I learned to budget (sort of), to do my own laundry (mostly), and to advocate for myself. There were moments of intense homesickness, moments of doubt, and moments where I seriously considered dropping out and becoming a professional cat cuddler.\n\nBut I made it. I passed my classes, made some incredible friends, and grew more than I ever thought possible in just nine months. I'm still figuring things out, but I'm heading into second year feeling a little more confident, a lot more tired, and incredibly grateful for the experience. To all the incoming first-years: buckle up, it's wild, but you got this!",
