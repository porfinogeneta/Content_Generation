1 
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
 Flicker was 

2 
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,740
 not just 

3 
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,100
 any fox. 

4 
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:01,720
 He was 

5 
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:01,940
 a blur 

6 
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,360
 of russet 

7 
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:02,580
 and white, 

8 
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,200
 a whisper 

9 
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,560
 of motion 

10 
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:03,720
 through 

11 
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:03,980
 the ancient 

12 
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,500
 emberwood forest. 

13 
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:05,480
 His paws, 

14 
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:05,960
 light as 

15 
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,400
 falling leaves, 

16 
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,140
 barely disturbed 

17 
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,500
 the mossy 

18 
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:07,660
 ground 

19 
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:07,860
 as he 

20 
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,260
 weaved between 

21 
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:08,620
 marbled roots 

22 
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,000
 and towering 

23 
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,960
 ferns. Today, 

24 
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,260
 the scent 

25 
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:10,500
 of a 

26 
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:10,780
 plump field 

27 
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,080
 mouse had 

28 
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,360
 drawn into 

29 
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:11,560
 the edge 

30 
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:11,820
 of Farmer 

31 
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,380
 McGregor's sprawling 

32 
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:12,860
 vegetable patch, 

33 
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,500
 a place 

34 
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,060
 usually fraught 

35 
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,140
 with 

36 
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:14,940
 danger. But 

37 
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,280
 Flicker was 

38 
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,860
 hungry, and 

39 
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,100
 his speed 

40 
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,320
 was his 

41 
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,140
 shield. He 

42 
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:17,340
 saw the 

43 
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:17,840
 mouse, a 

44 
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:17,980
 tiny, 

45 
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,600
 unsuspecting bundle 

46 
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:18,860
 of gray, 

47 
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:19,600
 nibbling on 

48 
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:19,840
 a fallen 

49 
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,560
 berry. Flicker 

50 
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:20,840
 crouched, 

51 
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,700
 muscles coiled 

52 
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,040
 like springs, 

53 
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:22,760
 his amber 

54 
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,140
 eyes fixed 

55 
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,380
 on his 

56 
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,260
 prey. A 

57 
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:24,560
 sudden wrestle 

58 
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:24,780
 in the 

59 
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,080
 undergrowth, 

60 
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:25,580
 a dog. 

61 
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,460
 Old Barnaby, 

62 
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:26,880
 the farmer's 

63 
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,320
 grumpy hound, 

64 
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:27,660
 had cut 

65 
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:27,940
 his scent. 

66 
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:28,900
 Most foxes 

67 
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,060
 would have 

68 
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,220
 scored 

69 
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:29,560
 bolt in 

70 
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:29,760
 a straight 

71 
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,560
 line. But 

72 
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:30,840
 Flicker was 

73 
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,120
 not just 

74 
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,480
 any fox. 

75 
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,000
 He was 

76 
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,200
 a blur 

77 
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,580
 of russet 

78 
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:32,760
 and white. 

79 
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,340
 Now, Flicker 

80 
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:33,700
 was different, 

81 
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,260
 and a 

82 
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:34,580
 flash he 

83 
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:34,800
 didn't just 

84 
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,020
 run in 

85 
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,320
 fact as.
