1 
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260
 Flicker was 

2 
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,340
 not just 

3 
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:00,580
 any fox, 

4 
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:00,880
 he was 

5 
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,000
 a blur 

6 
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,180
 of resin 

7 
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:01,520
 white, a 

8 
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:01,700
 whisper of 

9 
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:01,880
 motion to 

10 
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:02,000
 the ancient 

11 
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,300
 emerald forest. 

12 
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:02,740
 His paws 

13 
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,000
 light as 

14 
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,220
 long leaves, 

15 
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:03,560
 early as 

16 
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:03,740
 dark months 

17 
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,040
 he weaved 

18 
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,360
 between northerns 

19 
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,540
 and torrents 

20 
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:04,660
 firms. 

21 
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,060
 Today the 

22 
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,220
 scent of 

23 
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:05,500
 plumpium has 

24 
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:05,680
 drawn to 

25 
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:05,780
 the edge 

26 
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:05,920
 of armor 

27 
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,160
 breakers' royal 

28 
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,340
 mesh to 

29 
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:06,460
 patch. 

30 
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:06,760
 A face 

31 
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,020
 usually fraught 

32 
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,180
 with danger, 

33 
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:07,600
 a flicker 

34 
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:07,780
 is hungry 

35 
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,000
 and his 

36 
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 feet are 

37 
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,460
 shielded. 

38 
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:08,620
 He saw 

39 
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:08,780
 the mouse, 

40 
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,020
 a tiny 

41 
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:09,260
 aspect in 

42 
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:09,320
 a little 

43 
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,460
 gray, 

44 
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:09,760
 the lily 

45 
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:09,900
 on a 

46 
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,040
 fawn very 

47 
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,580
 flicker-crunched, 

48 
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:10,860
 muscle-coil 

49 
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,060
-like springs, 

50 
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:11,400
 his amber 

51 
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,580
 eyes fixed 

52 
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:11,700
 on a 

53 
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:11,780
 spray. 

54 
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,200
 The sun 

55 
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:12,460
 rustling under 

56 
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:12,680
 growth, the 

57 
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,100
 dog, will 

58 
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,280
 barge the 

59 
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,520
 farmer's body 

60 
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:13,760
 hound to 

61 
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:13,900
 cut his 

62 
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:13,980
 head. 

63 
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,480
 Those foxes 

64 
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:14,720
 were both 

65 
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:14,840
 in a 

66 
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,020
 straight line, 

67 
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,360
 but Flicker 

68 
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,520
 was not 

69 
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:15,640
 just any 

70 
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:15,980
 fox, he 

71 
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,060
 was a 

72 
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:16,200
 blur of 

73 
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,420
 resin white, 

74 
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:16,620
 and the 

75 
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:16,760
 litter was 

76 
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,100
 different, and 

77 
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,260
 a flashing 

78 
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,480
 interest in 

79 
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:17,620
 factors.
